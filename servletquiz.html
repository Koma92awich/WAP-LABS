        <h3>Solutions to Introduction to servlet Quiz </h3>
        
 <p>1.  Web server refers to an execution infrastructure that handles HTTP requests and responses.
 A web container container refers to a component of the web server that interacts with Java servlets and manages the lifecycle for servlets.</p>

<p>2.A servlet is a Java programming language class that is used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means 
of a request-response programming model. Mosttly to extend application hosted by web servers.</p>

<p>3. By using the Hyper text transfer protocol  over TCP/IP. When a request comes to the web server, if the server sees the request is for 
a servlet, it passes the request data to the servlet container. 
 The servlet container locates the servlet, creates request and response objects and passes them to the servlet, and returns to the web
 server the response stream that the servlet produces</p>

<p>4.Request objects are created by the servlet/web container.</p>

<p>5. States in the Life cycle of a servlet<br/>
-Servlet class is loaded.<br/>
-Servlet instance is created.<br/>
-init method is invoked.<br/>
-service method is invoked.<br/>
-destroy method is invoked.</p>

<p>6.The web/servlet container calls the init method only once after creating the servlet instance. 
The init method is used to initialize the servlet. It is the life cycle method of the javax.servlet.Servlet interface. Syntax of the init method is :
public void init(ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {.........} .</p>

<p>7. You should override the doGet method from the HttpServlet class.</p>

<p>8. Servlets are multithreaded in the sense that each time the service method is invoked , for each request there is a seperate thread running.

<p>9. Servlet instance variables are shared by all threads created for each request when the service method is invoked. Hence not thread safe.</p>
